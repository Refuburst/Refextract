Increasing innovation, productivity, and profitable business  performance in the digital era involves using new technologies and developing a culture digital  culture. OWL was formed in 1948 as an engineering company and grew internationally in 1998  to take advantage of digital options. The company faced challenges such as employees' initial  reservations to work from home while dealing with the COVID-19 and financial crisis of 2008  while improving communication through remote work. The main aim is to increase the  international operation of OWL company, deal with challenges related to management and  leadership while using digital technology to improve profitability and improve more solid  communication that was developed during the pandemic.  Digital Transformation Strategies for OWL   Issue 1:Behaviour tracking in consumer product   To enhance the products and services, behaviour tracking in consumer products includes  gathering and evaluating the data on how customers behave and their preferences (Sundararaj  and Rejeesh, 2021). Applying behaviour tracking provides OWL company with a strategic  advantage for enhancing customer satisfaction and more accurately aligning its product with  market requirements. OWL can gain information about the preferences of the customer,  patterns of buying, and level of satisfaction through using a behaviour-tracking strategy. The  company can change its services in accordance with the changing requirements of customers  by using this information to influence the development of products, advertising strategies, and  programs for customer services. This strategy is in line with OWL's commitment to digital  transformation, which includes using modern technologies to improve business operations.  OWL will have to include advanced analytics and data processing capacity in its present system  to be able to execute behaviour tracking effectively. The complexities of OWL company's  present systems, the level of integrating data required, and the size of behaviour-tracking  projects will all influence the speed at which the installation is completed. Within a couple of  months, a planned strategy targeting interaction with customers could demonstrate the result.  Over the following years, behaviour tracking could be further improved and developed to be  completely incorporated into the business process of OWL. This timeline guarantees that the  Page 4 of 19    execution is planned and progressive in accordance with the overall aim of OWL's digital  transformation.      Figure: Behaviour tracking in customer product (Radu, V, 2023)    Issue 2: Enhance workforce training   The digital transformation strategy of OWL involves enhancing workforce training as an  important aspect, taking knowledge gained from the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits are  many as they deal with problems caused by the rebranding, international growth, and demands  for united leadership. Firstly, by financing training for the employees, OWL has the ability to  fill any skill shortage that could exist and make sure that employees have the ability to deal  with transforming market conditions and developments in technology. Secondly, enhanced  education can develop a more united company atmosphere, decreasing previous challenges  caused by sections in the relieved and confused structure of management (Obrenovic et al.,  2020). The result is in employee satisfaction more shared choice making and improved  profitability.  Introducing a comprehensive training initiative that utilizes digital tools, online materials, and  likely other professionals, OWL is able to put this strategy to work. A structured and effective  implementation can be an essential division. The scope and level of detail of the education  Page 5 of 19    initiative will impact how much time this program will take to complete. Implementation is  staged throughout the next 1 year to 2 years, which might follow the initial evaluation and  program design, which may require several months. This employee training expenditure  encourages the capability of OWL to overcome challenges and forces the company to a  successful future in the digital era.    Figure: Enhancing Workforce Training (Source: Vector Solutions, 2021)  Issue 3: Transparency supply chain    Introducing transparency in the supply chain where OWL can enhance productivity,  transparency, and responsibility. OWL can guarantee moral behaviour and promote trust  among stakeholders by using digital features and technology to provide realtime information  to its supply chain methods. The strategy requires a combination of data analytics, blockchain,  and advanced tracking systems (Chen, Lv, and Song, 2019). The duration of time required for  execution can vary from a few months to a year, depending on the complex structure of the  supply chain of OWL and the condition of the structures of partnership required with partners  and suppliers. The commitment of OWL to charge company behaviour and excellent operations  is aligned with its investment in honesty.        Page 6 of 19      Figure: Supply Chain Transparency (Source: Stratmg.com (Mody, P, 2022))    Issue 4: Streamline research and development.   Research and development streamlining is important to the digital transformation of OWL. The  use of modern technologies, teamwork features, and data analytics can boost the success rate  of study and creation methods. This requires streamlining laborious processes, supporting  cooperation between departments and implementing them in centralized systems (Wahyoedi et  al., 2023). The strategy requires optimizing the allocation of resources, decreasing the time of  the market, and boosting innovation. The R&D facilities at OWL will decide when the  execution will be completed. An organized strategy may result in developments in less than a  year. This strategy works with the history of OWL of adaptability and creates the company for  future success in the constantly changing workplace.   Page 7 of 19    Technology implementation roadmap     Figure: Roadmap  Source: Created through Canva   OWL wants to include IoT for real-time tracking, AI for data analysis, and RPA for efficient  workflows with the goal of promoting digital transformation in the manufacturing industry.  OWL applies IoT sensors for the information of customers in behaviour tracking. Through  using digital features to boost development and teamwork like Autodesk, methods of agile and  streamlined R&D are all essential.     Conclusion   In conclusion, the transformation of OWL from an engineering company to an international  business shows determination and adaptability. The company has done well in spite of the  challenges with redesigning and foreign growth. It has successfully surpassed the financial  crisis of 2008 and used the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for global cooperation. The  suggested strategy that can improve the development of the company, like optimizing training  for employees, a supply chain, and more effective study and development, puts Owl in a solid  position for growth in the digital era. The commitment of Owl to standard will be improved by  Page 8 of 19    adopting innovation and dealing with internal factors, maintaining its place at the top of the  transforming customer services industry.                                                                                   Page 9 of 19    Part 2: Critical Essay     Introduction   The requirement of digital transformation has become obvious in the constantly changing  worldwide environment of business. OWL, an international company with beginnings in 1948,  this research discusses some of the most recent advancements in technological advances. OWL  could transform its activities internationally by using developments like cloud computing, IoT,  AI, and platforms for collaboration. Through actively implementing modern technologies,  OWL builds a technologically capable and internationally competitive company while also  simultaneously guaranteeing efficiency in operation and presenting it to deal with the  challenges of a constantly changing market.  Literature review    In a constantly changing firm environment, digital transformation has grown into an important  requirement for businesses looking for ways to maintain relevance and rivalry. This  transformation in the manufacturing industry combines modern technologies into multiple  operational processes with the objective of enhancing company profitability, productivity, and  advancements. The discussion of the literature appears in case studies that currently exist to  better understand the methods, challenges, and consequences of digital transformation in the  manufacturing industry.   1. Digital Transformation strategies:  The authors Javaid, Haleem, Singh, Rab, and Suman (2021) stated that multiple case  studies show how technology for sensors and the Internet of Things can be effectively merged  in the manufacturing sector. An international supplier of drive and maintain technologies, an  example of just how sensors are powered by the Internet of Things. Maintenance planning, the  current time of performance of machinery tracking, and manufacturing optimization of the  process became possible by the execution, which produced important savings in expenses and  higher productivity.  Smart Manufacturing Platforms:  According to Nath, Dunkin, Chowdhary, and Patel (2020), the implementation of  innovative production platforms is also identified by research. One interesting example is the  Page 10 of 19    amazing manufacturing suite General Electric (GE) digital. GE properly designed schedules  for manufacturing and improved the overall effectiveness of equipment through the use of data  analytics, robotics, and machine learning, which contributed to higher manufacturing  efficiency and quality. If the OWL company also follows this strategy like the GE company,  then it will be beneficial for the development of the OWL company.  Advanced analytics: Bosch Rexroth applied artificial intelligence and advanced data  analysis in the oversetting of maintenance planning. Similarly, Quatrini, Costantino, Di Gravio,  and Patriarca (2020) stated that the company executed an ongoing maintenance strategy by  using sensor data and machine learning algorithms to continuously track its machines. As a  result, there has been a lesser amount of downtime, less funds used for maintenance, and more  machinery reliability. If the OWL company also follows this strategy like the BOSCH  company, then it will be beneficial for the development of the OWL company.   2. Behaviour tracking in consumer product   Personalization and customization: According to Tian, Coreynen, Matthyssens, and  Shen (2022), in the industry, manufacturing tracking behaviour is above the manufacturing  path to involve products for consumer international athletic wear companies. Adidas has  effectively integrated behaviour tracking towards its items to make themselves more  personalized and customised to the customers. The shoes made by Adidas come with a  miniature device called the miCoach Speed Cell, which cracks customer exercise-related  performance outcomes. Adidas has the capacity to personalize products according to the  requirements and preferences of every customer by using the information that is gained to guide  the design of the product. If the OWL company also follows this strategy like Adidas, then it  will be beneficial for the development of the OWL company.  Improved customer experience: Similar to Saarikko, Westergren, and Blomquist  (2020), the behaviour-tracking strategy applies to strategies for digital transformation support  to make for a better experience for customers. Case studies suggest how companies like Tesla  track the behaviour of users, choices, and outcomes through information from the vehicles that  are connected. Personalized experiences from driving and higher levels of brand loyalty are  generated through the use of this information as the basis updates through the air. If the OWL  company also follows this strategy like Tesla, then it will be beneficial for the development of  the OWL company.   Page 11 of 19    3. Streamline research and development  Platforms of cooperation for R&D: From the viewpoints of Mugge, Abbu, Michaelis,  Kwiatkowski, and Gudergan (2020), research and development (R&D) methods are able to be  streamlined in a significant manner through the implementation of digital transformation. The  software company Autodesk supplies an example that demonstrates the connection of  platforms for collaboration. Autodesk concentrates on 3D engineering and design. Through the  support of Autodesk's Fusion 360 platform, engineers, designers, and manufacturers can work  together in different fields in a digital work environment with ease. The creation of products  increases, mistakes are reduced, and creativity is boosted by this combination. If the OWL  company also follows this strategy like the Autodesk company, then it will be beneficial for  the development of the OWL company.  Agile development with digital tools: Contrary to Dragičević, Zoran, and Saša Bošnjak (2019),  research and development could be streamlined through the use of agile methods of  development that are supported by digital tools. The use of digital twin technology for the  performance optimization of wind turbines and simulation is shown using a case study on  General Electric's Digital Wind Farm. This method significantly reduces the time and cost  related to standard testing, resulting in increased creation cycles and improved choice-making  throughout the study and design stage. If the OWL company also follows this strategy, like  General Electric's Digital Wind Farm company, then it will be beneficial for the development  of the OWL company.    Current technological trends and application.   The way of doing business innovatively in the creative service sectors has been made possible  with the emergence of digital technologies. In the course of the past twenty years, there has  been rapid growth in the concept of developing business models. Digital technologies have  helped in the enhancement of the company's structure in multiple sectors (Li, 2020).  Implementation of interchangeable approaches, transactional structures, and boundary-pushing  structures of organizations has been made possible through the inventiveness of the business  with the help of digital technologies. To construct the transformation of a business structure,  three important aspects need to be considered: automation, extension, and transformation.  Automation is when a company uses digital technologies to improve the ongoing operational  processes, for instance, to display information or to improve the communication process. The  extension is when a company uses digital technologies to implement new approaches to  Page 12 of 19    business practices, which does not completely replace the existing operational way but rather  enhances it, and the third category is transformation, where the company replaces the  conventional methods of business practice with the new digital technologies (Li, 2020).  By implementing several current technologies and programs, OWL can speed up its digital  transformation. These developments will ensure OWL's competition in the international  market, improve efficiency in operation, and enhance communication. Some of the current  technological trends and applications that can be taken into consideration for the digital  transformation of OWL for better operation across the world are:  Cloud computing: By using cloud computing services, adaptability and flexibility in operation  can be developed by Owl. Cloud computing platforms like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web  Services (AWS) allow all information to be securely stored and retrieved from anywhere in the  world (Wittig and Wittig, 2023). This encourages a wide range of OWL services by providing  effortless interaction among global teams as well as efficient information storage and  processing.  Internet of Things: The operational information can be entirely improved through the  integration of IoT devices into the manufacturing procedures of OWL. Real-time data on  machine operation can be collected through IoT centres or machines, helping with maintenance  prediction and reducing time spent. Furthermore, tracking of supply chains afforded by the  Internet of Things can boost traceability and open communication, ensuring efficient resources  and logistics management (Khan et al., 2022).  Artificial intelligence and Machine learning: The uses of machine learning and artificial  intelligence are likely to be very beneficial in improving various aspects of OWL. Forecasting  the demand, controlling inventory, and manufacturing planning will all benefit from statistical  analysis. Power by AI quality control systems can increase production reliability and decrease  mistakes. In addition, algorithms that use machine learning can analyse previous information  to identify trends and then make smart decisions, which improves procedures everywhere  (Akbari and Do 2021).  Robotic process automation: Daily life and based on rule projects can be programmed through  the integration of robotic process automation into the procedures of OWL. The use of  technology increases efficiency in operations, decreases mistakes, and streamlines company  procedures. Robotic process automation is able to, for example, streamline data entry, billing  Page 13 of 19    purposes, and other routine work, releasing human resources to perform more innovative and  strategic jobs (Kokina and Blanchette, 2019).  Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR): These innovations are capable of  enhancing training and cooperation within OWL. Through the use of augmented reality  software, employees are able to get remote maintenance support from any location in the world,  which removes the requirement for onsite visits. Virtual reality is able to be used to develop  complete training courses. These kinds of courses are particularly beneficial for difficult  manufacturing procedures because they ensure a similar development of skills between  different teams.  Foreseeable challenges associated with digital transformation strategy     Figure: Major barriers to digital transformation  Source: (Chanias, Myers, and Hess, 2019)  With the wide range of opportunities that digital technologies offer, it has its drawbacks as  well. Some of the following preventive measures need to be kept in mind for OWL while  implementing the digital transformation application:   Opposed to transformation: While implementing digital technologies, sometimes the company  faces challenges internally. The employees could resist adopting the new technologies due to  unfamiliarity and lack of experience or the fear of losing the position they hold. Conducting  effective management techniques on transformation by encouraging the participation of all the  employees in open and transparent communication can minimize the resistance to an effective  digital transformation. According to McKinsey& Company report, accepting the digital  transformation in a company varies accordingly. A company with less than 100 employees is  Page 14 of 19    more likely to shift to digital transformation in comparison to organizations with a large number  of employees above 50,000.   Data safety and privacy issues: The steady increase in the number of activities that are  happening on the internet creates an enormous amount of information. Even though statistics  are used to improve customer assistance and provide relevant goods, they also have negative  consequences (Fainmesser, Galeotti, and Momot, 2023). There is an increasing probability of  theft of information and violation of privacy for technologies that rely on data as it has become  widely used across. Therefore, OWL needs to establish reliable digital security to protect its  operation and stick to the rules and regulations to safeguard its information, for instance, the  General Data Protection Regulation, to maintain credibility and to avoid the consequences in  terms of law (Fainmesser, Galeotti and Momot, 2023).   Synchronization of technologies: Sometimes, it is challenging to incorporate new advanced  technologies into the already existing old software systems, which can result in hindrances to  the smooth functioning of the system. With the implementation of advanced technologies, it  can be an opportunity for employees to develop new expertise and skills. Programs to educate  and train the employees should be organized by OWL. Prioritizing skill development for the  employees through digital transformation will increase operational efficiency, improve  financial performance, and increase the possibilities for the company to position itself in the  marketplace and achieve its objectives (Oduro, De Nisco, and Mainolfi, 2023).  Organizational culture and financial restrictions: Making use of digital technologies in an  effective way often requires modifications in the culture; management is extremely important  for the organization to create an environment for inventiveness, partnership, and continual  growth. Cost overturn and financial restrictions are other key challenges while implementing  digital transformation. For the business to keep the expenses within check during digital  transformation, OWL must set up budgets while additionally monitoring its financial activities.  An integrated and adaptive approach that emphasizes cooperation, communication, and  commitment to constant growth during the process of digital transformation must be considered  to successfully navigate these barriers.   Ethical and social consideration   In comparison to the conventional beliefs on IT-facilitated organizational structure, in today's  world, companies use digital innovation technologies for operational purposes in a setting  where adverse environmental impact arose because of the increase in the use of digital  technologies both in the industry as well as in the society. The application of digital  technologies in a company can be seen from various perspectives, either as a beginning for the  Page 15 of 19    establishment purpose or as an effect for the greater outcome for the company at the end (Vial,  2021).   As OWL implements the global digital transformation program, it must take the moral and  social consequences into account with some of the significant elements like machine learning,  transparency in the supply network, and monitoring of data.  Monitoring services:  With the growing application of data tracking devices, especially when  it comes to consumers buying products, concerns regarding the ethics surrounding  confidentiality, security, and individual freedom have raised challenges. Therefore, OWL  needs to ensure its clients' accuracy, permission, and legality with data protection rules while  gathering individual clients' information. By abiding by the ethical and moral principles to  maintain the confidentiality of the user, it can also offer procedures for monitoring data, which  will help the company establish its credibility. Regarding social impact, data tracking can  reinforce the underlying preconceptions; therefore, OWL needs to understand the biases caused  by algorithms and make choices from the accurate generation of data.   According to Lobschat (2021), business companies should not depend solely on legal and  regulatory requirements as these cannot keep pace with the rapidly evolving digital  technologies. Instead, they should implement a list of principles related to Corporate Digital  Responsibility by establishing strategic as well as operational protocols to comply with the  needs of the stakeholders.  Accountability in the supply networks and workforce automation:  For an organization to  maintain transparency in the supply network, it must share the data across different parties who  are involved. By creating an equal workplace environment and being environmentally  responsible are some of the moral conducts that OWL can implement through the supply  network. Having operational transparency in a socially responsible manner will make the  clients more inclined to the company's products.   The development of computerization in the workforce may hurt livelihoods and lead to the loss  of employment. Therefore, the company must make sure to make equitable changes by  providing its employees with digital training opportunities. However, the transformation will  implore operation efficiency and production; it will impact the employment landscape. With  the help of vocational education and training programs, it can have a positive social effect.  Making an inclusive approach to support the community's larger objective will help the  company survive in the marketplace for the long term.  Page 16 of 19    Security consideration    Prioritizing security is of the utmost importance for a company to make a global digitalization  transformation to safeguard the confidentiality of consumer data, maintain operational  adaptability, and address cyber-attacks. Some of the important cyber security factors are:   Safeguarding the data: A highly secure encryption technique will secure the processing of the  information. The process for authentication, along with the accessibility limitations, ensures  that only those individuals with permission can access private information. To detect and  minimize the theft of information, timely inspection and surveillance is essential.  Implementing awareness initiatives for security measures against cybercrime among  employees is important to avoid any malware-based fraud like phishing, aching, or any other  psychological harm. Therefore, developing an emergency response plan is important for OWL  to bounce back from security dangers.  Safety of cloud service: Cloud service is used for handling and storage of data. Therefore,  OWL needs to set up a reliable authorization protocol; while transferring or storing  information, it should be highly encrypted as well, and regular assessment of the cloud services  is required for safety measures.  Legal enforcement: To safeguard and maintain the privacy of the data, it is important to abide  by all the relevant regulations. Digital transformation initiatives can be developed by following  the requirements of the constantly changing laws and regulations, such as the General Data  Protection Regulation and other industry-specific norms.   Cyber-attacks are a serious risk in today's time, with the importance and security of data has  risen above cash, gold, and other worthy things. Therefore, organizations need to keep  reinventing their organizational framework in the age of technology (Moşteanu, 2020).  Conclusion    In conclusion, for implementing global digital transformation for OWL. There are considerable  opportunities for inventiveness and profitability. While addressing the ethical, social, and  security concerns, the company can navigate the challenges and adopt technical advancements.  Supporting the advancement of the employees by providing them with skills development,  being adaptable and emphasizing transparency will help to not only overcome the hurdles but  also be able to establish itself as a technologically competent and environmentally responsible  corporation in the service sector.
